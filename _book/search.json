    "text": "1.4 Grammar of Graphics\nBefore we getting started using ggplot2, it is important for us to understand the principles of Grammer of Graphics.\nGrammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\n\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\n\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n1.4.1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\n\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background."

    "section": "3.1 Overview",
    "text": "3.1 Overview\nDeveloped in 1932 by Rensis Likert to measure attitudes, the typical Likert scale is a 5- or 7-point ordinal scale used by respondents to rate the degree to which they agree or disagree with a statement (table). In an ordinal scale, responses can be rated or ranked, but the distance between responses is not measurable. Thus, the differences between “always,” “often,” and “sometimes” on a frequency response Likert scale are not necessarily equal. In other words, one cannot assume that the difference between responses is equidistant even though the numbers assigned to those responses are.\nDiverging stacked bar charts are often the best choice when visualizing Likert scale data. There are various ways to produce these graphs, there are:\n\nlikert package,\nlikert function of HH package, and\nplot_liker function of sjPlot package\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will focus on using likert function of HH package."

    "title": "4  Programming Animated Statistical Graphics with R",
    "section": "4.1 Overview",
    "text": "4.1 Overview\nWhen telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n4.1.1 Basic concepts of animation\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Terminology\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts."

    "text": "3.4 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods\nggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n3.4.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Displaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip <- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Customising Tooltip style\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css <- \"background-color:white; #<<\nfont-style:bold; color:black;\" #<<\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(    #<<\n    opts_tooltip(    #<<\n      css = tooltip_css)) #<<\n)                                        \n\nNotice that the background colour of the tooltip is black and the font colour is white and bold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to Customizing girafe objects to learn more about how to customise ggiraph objects.\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Displaying statistics on tooltip\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.\n\ntooltip <- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {\n  mean <- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  sem <- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  paste(\"Mean maths scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem)\n}\n\ngg_point <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n                   aes(x = RACE),\n) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS, \n                   tooltip = after_stat(  \n                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  \n    fun.data = \"mean_se\", \n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,  \n    fill = \"light blue\"\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS),\n    fun.data = mean_se,\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, size = 0.2\n  )\n\ngirafe(ggobj = gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.5 Hover effect with data_id aesthetic\nCode chunk below shows the second interactive feature of ggiraph, namely data_id.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(           \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),             \n    stackgroups = TRUE,               \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618                      \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the default value of the hover css is hover_css = “fill:orange;”.\n\n\n3.4.6 Styling hover effect\nIn the code chunk below, css codes are used to change the highlighting effect.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Different from previous example, in this example the ccs customisation request are encoded directly.\n\n\n3.4.7 Combining tooltip and hover effect\nThere are time that we want to combine tooltip and hover effect on the interactive statistical graph as shown in the code chunk below.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = CLASS, \n        data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.

It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

For the purpose of this hands-on exercise, two data sets will be used. They are:\n\nGDP.csv provides GDP, GDP per capita and GDP PPP data for world countries from 2000 to 2020. The data was extracted from World Development Indicators Database of World Bank.\nWorldCountry.csv provides a list of country names and the continent they belong to extracted from Statistics Times.\nWrite a code chunk to import both data sets by using read_csv() of readr package.\n\nThe solution:\n\nGDP <- read_csv(\"chap03/data/GDP.csv\")\nWorldCountry <- read_csv(\"chap03/data/WorldCountry.csv\")\n\nNote: It is always a good practice to check the data structure and examine data values in RStudio.\n\n3.7.1 Data preparetion\nBefore programming the data visualisation, it is important for us to reshape, wrangle and transform the raw data to meet the data visualisation need.\nCode chunk below performs following tasks:\n\nmutate() of dplyr package is used to convert all values in the 202 field into numeric data type.\nselect() of dplyr package is used to extract column 1 to 3 and Values field.\npivot_wider() of tidyr package is used to split the values in Series Name field into columns.\nleft_join() of dplyr package is used to perform a left-join by using Country Code of GDP_selected and ISO-alpha3 Code of WorldCountry tibble data tables as unique identifier.\n\n\nGDP_selected <- GDP %>%\n  mutate(Values = as.numeric(`2020`)) %>%\n  select(1:3, Values) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = `Series Name`,\n              values_from = `Values`) %>%\n  left_join(y=WorldCountry, by = c(\"Country Code\" = \"ISO-alpha3 Code\"))\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Introducing packed bar method\n\npacked bar is a relatively new data visualisation method introduced by Xan Gregg from JMP.\n\nIt aims to support the need of visualising skewed data over hundreds of categories.\n\nThe idea is to support the Focus+Context data visualization principle.\nVisit this JMP Blog to learn more about the design principles of packed bar.\n\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Data Preparation\nAs usual, we need to prepare the data before building the packed bar.

    "section": "5.1 Overview",
    "text": "5.1 Overview\nDeveloped in 1932 by Rensis Likert to measure attitudes, the typical Likert scale is a 5- or 7-point ordinal scale used by respondents to rate the degree to which they agree or disagree with a statement (table). In an ordinal scale, responses can be rated or ranked, but the distance between responses is not measurable. Thus, the differences between “always,” “often,” and “sometimes” on a frequency response Likert scale are not necessarily equal. In other words, one cannot assume that the difference between responses is equidistant even though the numbers assigned to those responses are.\nDiverging stacked bar charts are often the best choice when visualizing Likert scale data. There are various ways to produce these graphs, there are:\n\nlikert package,\nlikert function of HH package, and\nplot_liker function of sjPlot package\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will focus on using likert function of HH package."

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\n9.3.5 How to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.

    "text": "6.1 Overview\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coefficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coefficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\n\nTo reveal the relationship between high-dimensional variables pair-wisely.\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrices as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\n\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\n\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R. Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R."

It uses the default pairs function. Columns 2 to 12 of wine dataframe is used to build the scatterplot matrix.

    "text": "6.7 Visualising Correlation Matrix using corrplot Package\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will focus on corrplot. However, you are encouraged to explore the other two packages too.\nBefore getting started, you are required to read An Introduction to corrplot Package in order to gain basic understanding of corrplot package.\n\n6.7.1 Getting started with corrplot\nBefore we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\nIn the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\nwine.cor <- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the default visual object used to plot the corrgram is circle. The default layout of the corrgram is a symmetric matrix. The default colour scheme is diverging blue-red. Blue colours are used to represent pair variables with positive correlation coefficients and red colours are used to represent pair variables with negative correlation coefficients. The intensity of the colour or also know as saturation is used to represent the strength of the correlation coefficient. Darker colours indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\n6.7.2 Working with visual geometrics\nIn corrplot package, there are seven visual geometrics (parameter method) can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. The default is circle. As shown in the previous section, the default visual geometric of corrplot matrix is circle. However, this default setting can be changed by using the method argument as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\nFeel free to change the method argument to other supported visual geometrics.\n\n\n6.7.3 Working with layout\ncorrplor() supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”. The default is “full” which display full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the type argument of corrplot().\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\nThe default layout of the corrgram can be further customised. For example, arguments diag and tl.col are used to turn off the diagonal cells and to change the axis text label colour to black colour respectively as shown in the code chunk and figure below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to experiment with other layout design argument such as tl.pos, tl.cex, tl.offset, cl.pos, cl.cex and cl.offset, just to mention a few of them.\n\n\n6.7.4 Working with mixed layout\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\nFigure below shows a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk used to plot the corrgram are shown below.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\nNotice that argument lower and upper are used to define the visualisation method used. In this case ellipse is used to map the lower half of the corrgram and numerical matrix (i.e. number) is used to map the upper half of the corrgram. The argument tl.pos, on the other, is used to specify the placement of the axis label. Lastly, the diag argument is used to specify the glyph on the principal diagonal of the corrgram.\n\n\n6.7.5 Combining corrgram with the significant test\nIn statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables their correlation coefficients are statistically significant.\nFigure below shows a corrgram combined with the significant test. The corrgram reveals that not all correlation pairs are statistically significant. For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at significant level of 0.1 but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.6 Reorder a corrgram\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n“AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in seriation package.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.7 Reordering a correlation matrix using hclust\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

Moreover, the corresponding dendrogram are provided beside the heatmap.\n\nHere, red cells denotes small values, and red small ones. This heatmap is not really informative. Indeed, the Happiness Score variable have relatively higher values, what makes that the other variables with small values all look the same. Thus, we need to normalize this matrix.

We will still use the wh_matrix as the input data.\n\n14.5.1 Working with heatmaply\n\nheatmaply(mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows the basic syntax needed to create n interactive heatmap by using heatmaply package.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\nDifferent from heatmap(), for heatmaply() the default horizontal dendrogram is placed on the left hand side of the heatmap.\nThe text label of each raw, on the other hand, is placed on the right hand side of the heat map.\nWhen the x-axis marker labels are too long, they will be rotated by 135 degree from the north.\n\n\n\n14.5.2 Data trasformation\nWhen analysing multivariate data set, it is very common that the variables in the data sets includes values that reflect different types of measurement. In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.\nThree main data transformation methods are supported by heatmaply(), namely: scale, normalise and percentilse.\n\n14.5.2.1 Scaling method\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\n\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to scale variable values columewise.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.2.2 Normalising method\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\nDifferent from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.2.3 Percentising method\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\nSimilar to Normalize method, the Percentize method is also performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.3 Clustering algorithm\nheatmaply supports a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithm. The main arguments provided are:\n\ndistfun: function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist. The options “pearson”, “spearman” and “kendall” can be used to use correlation-based clustering, which uses as.dist(1 - cor(t(x))) as the distance metric (using the specified correlation method).\nhclustfun: function used to compute the hierarchical clustering when Rowv or Colv are not dendrograms. Defaults to hclust.\ndist_method default is NULL, which results in “euclidean” to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to distfun. By default distfun is “dist”” hence this can be one of “euclidean”, “maximum”, “manhattan”, “canberra”, “binary” or “minkowski”.\nhclust_method default is NULL, which results in “complete” method to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun. By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n\n14.5.4 Manual approach\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmap is plotted by using hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.5 Statistical approach\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\nwh_d <- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\nwh_clust <- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k <- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nWith reference to the statistical analysis results, we can prepare the code chunk as shown below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.6 Seriation\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.7 Working with colour palettes\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.8 The finishing touch\nBeside providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

    "text": "16.3 Data Wrangling\nIn this exercise, REALIS2018.csv data will be used. This dataset provides information of private property transaction records in 2018. The dataset is extracted from REALIS portal (https://spring.ura.gov.sg/lad/ore/login/index.cfm) of Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).\n\n16.3.1 Importing the data set\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr is used to import realis2018.csv into R and parsed it into tibble R data.frame format.\n\nrealis2018 <- read_csv(\"data/realis2018.csv\")\n\nThe output tibbled data.frame is called realis2018.\n\n\n16.3.2 Data Wrangling and Manipulation\nThe data.frame realis2018 is in trasaction record form, which is highly disaggregated and not appropriate to be used to plot a treemap. In this section, we will perform the following steps to manipulate and prepare a data.frtame that is appropriate for treemap visualisation:\n\ngroup transaction records by Project Name, Planning Region, Planning Area, Property Type and Type of Sale, and\ncompute Total Unit Sold, Total Area, Median Unit Price and Median Transacted Price by applying appropriate summary statistics on No. of Units, Area (sqm), Unit Price ($ psm) and Transacted Price ($) respectively.\n\nTwo key verbs of dplyr package, namely: group_by() and summarize() will be used to perform these steps.\ngroup_by() breaks down a data.frame into specified groups of rows. When you then apply the verbs above on the resulting object they’ll be automatically applied “by group”.\nGrouping affects the verbs as follows:\n\ngrouped select() is the same as ungrouped select(), except that grouping variables are always retained.\ngrouped arrange() is the same as ungrouped; unless you set .by_group = TRUE, in which case it orders first by the grouping variables.\nmutate() and filter() are most useful in conjunction with window functions (like rank(), or min(x) == x). They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).\nsample_n() and sample_frac() sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.\nsummarise() computes the summary for each group.\n\nIn our case, group_by() will used together with summarise() to derive the summarised data.frame.\nRecommendation:\n\nStudents who are new to dplyr methods should consult Introduction to dplyr before moving on to the next section.\n\n\n\n16.3.3 Grouped summaries without the Pipe\nThe code chank below shows a typical two lines code approach to perform the steps.\n\nrealis2018_grouped <- group_by(realis2018, `Project Name`,\n                               `Planning Region`, `Planning Area`, \n                               `Property Type`, `Type of Sale`)\nrealis2018_summarised <- summarise(realis2018_grouped, \n                          `Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE), \n                          `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nNote:\n\nAggregation functions such as sum() and meadian() obey the usual rule of missing values: if there’s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value. The argument na.rm = TRUE removes the missing values prior to computation.\n\nThe code chunk above is not very efficient because we have to give each intermediate data.frame a name, even though we don’t have to care about it.\n\n\n16.3.4 Grouped summaries with the pipe\nThe code chunk below shows a more efficient way to tackle the same processes by using the pipe, %>%:\nRecommendation:\n\nTo learn more about Pipe, visit this excellent article: Pipes in R Tutorial For Beginners.\n\n\nrealis2018_summarised <- realis2018 %>% \n  group_by(`Project Name`,`Planning Region`, `Planning Area`, `Property Type`, `Type of Sale`) %>%\n  summarise(`Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE), \n            `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))"

    "section": "16.4 Designing Treemap with treemap Package",
    "text": "16.4 Designing Treemap with treemap Package\ntreemap package is a R package specially designed to offer great flexibility in drawing treemaps. The core function, namely: treemap() offers at least 43 arguments. In this section, we will only explore the major arguments for designing elegent and yet truthful treemaps.\n\n16.4.1 Designing a static treemap\nIn this section, treemap() of Treemap package is used to plot a treemap showing the distribution of median unit prices and total unit sold of resale condominium by geographic hierarchy in 2017.\nFirst, we will select records belongs to resale condominium property type from realis2018_selected data frame.\n\nrealis2018_selected <- realis2018_summarised %>%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\", `Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\n\n\n16.4.2 Using the basic arguments\nThe code chunk below designed a treemap by using three core arguments of treemap(), namely: index, vSize and vColor.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the three arguments used:\n\nindex\n\nThe index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.\nIf multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.\n\nvSize\n\nThe column must not contain negative values. This is because it’s vaues will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.\n\n\nWarning:\nThe treemap above was wrongly coloured. For a correctly designed treemap, the colours of the rectagles should be in different intensity showing, in our case, median unit prices.\nFor treemap(), vColor is used in combination with the argument type to determines the colours of the rectangles. Without defining type, like the code chunk above, treemap() assumes type = index, in our case, the hierarchy of planning areas.\n\n\n16.4.3 Working with vColor and type arguments\nIn the code chunk below, type argument is define as value.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type = \"value\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\nThinking to learn from the conde chunk above.\n\nThe rectangles are coloured with different intensity of green, reflecting their respective median unit prices.\n\nThe legend reveals that the values are binned into ten bins, i.e. 0-5000, 5000-10000, etc. with an equal interval of 5000.\n\n\n\n16.4.4 Colours in treemap package\nThere are two arguments that determine the mapping to color palettes: mapping and palette. The only difference between “value” and “manual” is the default value for mapping. The “value” treemap considers palette to be a diverging color palette (say ColorBrewer’s “RdYlBu”), and maps it in such a way that 0 corresponds to the middle color (typically white or yellow), -max(abs(values)) to the left-end color, and max(abs(values)), to the right-end color. The “manual” treemap simply maps min(values) to the left-end color, max(values) to the right-end color, and mean(range(values)) to the middle color.\n\n\n16.4.5 The “value” type treemap\nThe code chunk below shows a value type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nalthough the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\n16.4.6 The “manual” type treemap\nThe “manual” type does not interpret the values as the “value” type does. Instead, the value range is mapped linearly to the colour palette.\nThe code chunk below shows a manual type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nThe colour scheme used is very copnfusing. This is because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)). It is not wise to use diverging colour palette such as RdYlBu if the values are all positive or negative\n\nTo overcome this problem, a single colour palette such as Blues should be used.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.7 Treemap Layout\ntreemap() supports two popular treemap layouts, namely: “squarified” and “pivotSize”. The default is “pivotSize”.\nThe squarified treemap algorithm (Bruls et al., 2000) produces good aspect ratios, but ignores the sorting order of the rectangles (sortID). The ordered treemap, pivot-by-size, algorithm (Bederson et al., 2002) takes the sorting order (sortID) into account while aspect ratios are still acceptable.\n\n\n16.4.8 Working with algorithm argument\nThe code chunk below plots a squarified treemap by changing the algorithm argument.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.9 Using sortID\nWhen “pivotSize” algorithm is used, sortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )"

In this step, we will write a function to perform the task.\n\nmake_hr_wkday <- function(ts, sc, tz) {\n  real_times <- ymd_hms(ts, \n                        tz = tz[1], \n                        quiet = TRUE)\n  dt <- data.table(source_country = sc,\n                   wkday = weekdays(real_times),\n                   hour = hour(real_times))\n  return(dt)\n  }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nymd_hms() and hour() are from lubridate package, and\nweekdays() is a base R function.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Deriving the attacks tibble data frame\n\nwkday_levels <- c('Saturday', 'Friday', \n                  'Thursday', 'Wednesday', \n                  'Tuesday', 'Monday', \n                  'Sunday')\n\nattacks <- attacks %>%\n  group_by(tz) %>%\n  do(make_hr_wkday(.$timestamp, \n                   .$source_country, \n                   .$tz)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(wkday = factor(\n    wkday, levels = wkday_levels),\n    hour  = factor(\n      hour, levels = 0:23))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBeside extracting the necessary data into attacks data frame, mutate() of dplyr package is used to convert wkday and hour fields into factor so they’ll be ordered when plotting\n\n\nTable below shows the tidy tibble table after processing.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntz\nsource_country\nwkday\nhour\n\n\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nBG\nSaturday\n20\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n6\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n8\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCN\nSunday\n11\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nUS\nSunday\n15\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCA\nMonday\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.3.5 Building the Calendar Heatmaps\n\ngrouped <- attacks %>% \n  count(wkday, hour) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n  na.omit()\n\nggplot(grouped, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \ngeom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \ntheme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \ncoord_equal() +\nscale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\nlabs(x = NULL, \n     y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks by weekday and time of day\") +\ntheme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n      legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n      legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk\n\n\n\n\na tibble data table called grouped is derived by aggregating the attack by wkday and hour fields.\na new field called n is derived by using group_by() and count() functions.\nna.omit() is used to exclude missing value.\ngeom_tile() is used to plot tiles (grids) at each x and y position. color and size arguments are used to specify the border color and line size of the tiles.\ntheme_tufte() of ggthemes package is used to remove unnecessary chart junk. To learn which visual components of default ggplot2 have been excluded, you are encouraged to comment out this line to examine the default plot.\ncoord_equal() is used to ensure the plot will have an aspect ratio of 1:1.\nscale_fill_gradient() function is used to creates a two colour gradient (low-high).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we can simply group the count by hour and wkday and plot it, since we know that we have values for every combination there’s no need to further preprocess the data.\n\n\n17.3.6 Building Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nChallenge: Building multiple heatmaps for the top four countries with the highest number of attacks.\n\n\n\n17.3.7 Plotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 1: Deriving attack by country object\nIn order to identify the top 4 countries with the highest number of attacks, you are required to do the followings:\n\ncount the number of attacks by country,\ncalculate the percent of attackes by country, and\nsave the results in a tibble data frame.\n\n\nattacks_by_country <- count(\n  attacks, source_country) %>%\n  mutate(percent = percent(n/sum(n))) %>%\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\nStep 2: Preparing the tidy data frame\nIn this step, you are required to extract the attack records of the top 4 countries from attacks data frame and save the data in a new tibble data frame (i.e. top4_attacks).\n\ntop4 <- attacks_by_country$source_country[1:4]\ntop4_attacks <- attacks %>%\n  filter(source_country %in% top4) %>%\n  count(source_country, wkday, hour) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(source_country = factor(\n    source_country, levels = top4)) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\n\n\n17.3.8 Plotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 3: Plotting the Multiple Calender Heatmap by using ggplot2 package.\n\nggplot(top4_attacks, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \n  theme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \n  coord_equal() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~source_country, ncol = 2) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks on top 4 countries by weekday and time of day\") +\n  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )"

In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Combining two ggplot2 graphs\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Combining three ggplot2 graphs\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“|” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“/” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\n2.5.4 Creating a composite figure with tag\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.5 Creating figure with insert\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np12 <- p1|p2\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Creating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatchwork <- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()"
