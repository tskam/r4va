In chapter 1 we have shared with you some of the popular statistical graphics methods for visualising distribution are histogram, probability density curve (pdf), boxplot, notch plot and violin plot and how they can be created by using ggplot2. In this chapter, we are going to share with you two relatively new statistical graphic methods for visualising distribution, namely ridgeline plot and raincloud plot by using ggplot2 and its extensions.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Installing and loading the packages\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:\n\n-   tidyverse, a family of R packages for data science process,\n-   ggridges, a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots, and\n-   ggdist for visualising distribution and uncertainty.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes,\n               colorspace, tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Data import\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, *Exam_data.csv* will be used.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexam <- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\n\n*Ridgeline plot* (sometimes called *Joyplot*) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\n\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chap09_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n-   Ridgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\n\n-   It works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n:::\n\n### Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using [ggridges](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/index.html) package.\n\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: [`geom_ridgeline()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/geom_ridgeline.html) and [`geom_density_ridges()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/geom_density_ridges.html). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\n\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using `geom_density_ridges()`.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### The plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chap09_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### The code chunk\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Varying fill colors along the x axis\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either [`geom_ridgeline_gradient()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/geom_ridgeline_gradient.html) or [`geom_density_ridges_gradient()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/geom_ridgeline_gradient.html). Both geoms work just like `geom_ridgeline()` and `geom_density_ridges()`, except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chap09_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The code chunk\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a \"raincloud\". The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does! \n\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by **ggdist** and ggplot2 packages.\n\n### Plotting a Half Eye graph\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using [`stat_halfeye()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_halfeye.html) of **ggdist** package. \n\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval. \n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The plot\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chap09_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The code chunk\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Things to learn from the code chunk above\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA. \n:::\n:::\n\n### Adding the boxplot with `geom_boxplot()`\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using [`geom_boxplot()`]() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The plot\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The code chunk\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chap09_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Adding the Dot Plots with `stat_dots()`\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using [`stat_dots()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_dots.html) of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = \"left\" to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The plot\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chap09_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The code chunk\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Finishing touch\n\nLastly, [`coord_flip()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_flip.html) of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, `theme_economist()` of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## The plot\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](chap09_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## The code chunk\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
