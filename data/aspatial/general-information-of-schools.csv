The current QtPS was formed through a merger of Mei Chin Primary, Tanglin Primary and the old Queenstown Primary in January 2002. The school underwent PRIME at the end of November 1999 when the old buildings were demolished and rebuilt on site. This is then followed by PERI upgrading in 2010.  The school believes that Every Child Matters and can Accomplish. With this belief, the school endeavours to develop  - A Child - a confident and happy child; motivated and passionate about learning. - An Explorer - one who embraces challenges and diversity, possesses an open mind, and dares to try new things. - A Friend - one who loves and cares for his family, shows care and concern for the less privileged, the community, the environment and the nation.  To achieve this, the school is committed to providing a holistic education to develop confident and self-directed learners, concerned citizens and active contributors.

Good Character is defined in two parts: (1) Performance Character refers to having the character that enables the child to do his/ her best to realise his/ her potential and (2) Moral Character which is to do the right thing to serve the larger community, and not just for self. These are further distilled to 4 Queenstowner Outcomes (QtOs) - Confident Individual, Critical Thinker, Caring Citizen and Effective Leader. To effect QtO, the school has put in place the following:  Connecting the heARTs with ARTs Curriculum - Our school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP)  The Visual Arts curriculum aims to  - Engage and Equip every student with the means to express himself, to develop a voice and a sense of self-worth. We hope that every student can taste success and be successful in accomplishing their goals through the medium of Visual Arts through a 6-year progressive curriculum. - Enrich groups of students who are interested or whose interest in the Visual Arts is yet to be discovered. The 3 Art-related CCAs are Ceramics (2D Relief and 3D), Chinese Brush Painting (2D) with Seal Carving (3D) and Photography. - Excel is to provide the opportunity within school to help students with talent in the Visual Arts to help them to excel and to learn and love the Visual Art like an Artist. Artworks produced by this group of students would also contribute to the community around us where required.  Character & Citizenship Education The school aims to develop CCE vision by focusing on fostering positivity to bring out the best in each child.

We believe that every child must develop the spirit of adventure to explore and pursue his interests, his talents, and his imagination, his sense of curiosity and wonder.

Importantly, he must grow up with the disposition and ability to learn, unlearn and relearn so that he will be well placed in secondary school, and for the future.

He should set high expectations for himself in his pursuits of his interests and talents and find his sense of purpose and meaningfulness in what he wishes to do or to grow up to become.

All FPPS students attend process drama lessons during which they explore complex real world issues. Teachers will then facilitate discussions on these issues with the aim to provide students opportunities to articulate their opinions and thinking, using evidence from the text to support their reasoning and decisions. Through process drama, students develop critical and inventive thinking skills, sound and logical reasoning skills and become confident, self-assured individuals.

FPPS collaborates with external partners such as Singapore Polytechnic to provide our students greater opportunities to learn through drama.

Our learning environment is one that focuses on providing a wide range of learning platforms for holistic development. Thus the learning experiences are designed to grow a child holistically addressing the 5 domains - Moral, Cognitive, Physical, Social and Aesthetics. We aspire to develop in every child good character and nourish his or her intellectual, social and emotional well-being. This is accomplished through daily learning experiences and joyful activities offered through the I-LEAD curriculum, Safe Play@ Horizon, Leaders' Trail in Biodiversity, P5 Computational Thinking in Mathematics, sessions, Making Thinking Visible routines based Aesthetic lessons, Design Thinking for P4 Project Work, language acquisition efforts and a range of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA).

The I-LEAD framework maps out the levels of progression, central themes and objectives, skills, competencies and values to be developed.

Cultivating this culture and tone is each staff member's responsibility and is demonstrated in the different facets of the school's curriculum deliveries; in how lessons are planned, how learning is shared, how safety is managed, how discipline is enforced and how relationships and partnerships are built. We also believe that a caring and collaborative culture does not compromise on the high academic standards and rigor expected. On the contrary; because a caring culture is about accountability for the students' academic performance, accountability to address the varied student needs, and accountability for the quality of programs offered, and because a collaborative culture is about progressing sharper learning with the help of others and vice versa.  A caring culture is the base from which we develop students who are ""Concerned citizens, Innovative Thinkers, Inspired for Excellence, Service and Influence"" as articulated in our school vision. In the course of their six-year journey, we hope that our students strengthen the caring culture in how they conduct themselves as a member of the school and community and in what they accomplish for self and for school.

TC@CPS identifies specific higher order thinking skills for each level,  to give better structure and form in teaching these skills eg. to 'create' at P5 and P6. Different strategies are adopted suited for the different subjects. To give a common language for discourse all teachers are trained in the 'Visible Thinking' approach through an on-line course by the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Students use the thinking strategies in the classrooms to learn about subject content. There are four levels of programmes that offer scope and depth for learning and practice. The first is at the classroom level, the second through school wide activities beyond the classroom, the third for students with specific inclinations and the fourth in external competitions and platforms. TC@CPS is to cultivate responsible and independent thinkers who will contribute positively to the community.

Because creativity requires experimentation and enterprise, our teachers understand the need to promote diversity and multiple perspectives even as they provide a large emotional safety net for our children to manage failures, disappointments and discouragements. When we inspire children to dream big dreams and empower them to believe in themselves and their abilities, they will develop confidence and achieve great things in life.

One example is the completion of Acts of Kindness cards by students to remind themselves to make a conscious effort to show kindness to others.  Here in NPS, on top of the progressive and differentiated student-centric curriculum, we offer an array of structured enrichment programmes from co-curricular programmes like International Chess Club to fun-filled activities during recess (like Art & Craft; Information Communication Technology infused Games; storytelling sessions), as well as daily pre-assembly talks and learning journeys that expose students to learning beyond the classrooms.",YISHUN,NORTH,NORTH 2,GOVERNMENT SCHOOL,CO-ED SCHOOL,SINGLE SESSION,PRIMARY,No,No,No,No,Chinese,Malay,Tamil,"Our two distinctive programmes: Learning for Life Programme (LLP) and Applied Learning Programme (ALP) were awarded by MOE in 2014 and 2016 respectively.

Additionally, there is one distinctive programme under each component of the Total Curriculum Framework; the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) under KNL and Learning for Life Programme (LLP) under the Action domain of CCLAS.  Our ALP, D.R.E.A.M. (Developing Reflective learners, Empowering creAtive Minds)@YTPS, focuses on knowledge acquisition as well as skills like collaborative learning, communication and independent learning.. Through Project Work, pupils use the Creative Problem Solving tool to go beyond conventional thinking and arrive at novel and useful solutions to a problem posed in an authentic and meaningful manner. Carried out from P1 to P6, each Project Work is anchored on a core subject. This allows pupils to acquire knowledge of the subject content through a process of co-construction, collaboration and experiential learning.  Our LLP, entitled HEROES@YTPS, provides Holistic Enriching and Rewarding Outdoor Education & Sports experiences for every pupil at Yew Tee Primary. Pupils have the opportunity to participate in learning activities including Programme for Active Learning (PAL), adventure camps, CCAs and the Sports Fiesta."

ACSJ's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) comprises Creative Thinkers for all which develop the 21st Century Skills Domains of Learning & Innovation skills, Information, Media & Technology skills and Life & Career Skills. In Creative Thinkers, students are engaged through purposeful play of quality games and Creative Problem Solving (CPS) activities deployed in the classroom. Additional support to the Academic Programme is provided through the Thoburn and Hinch Programmes, which seek to develop intellectual rigour, creativity and character values in students of all abilities.  ACSJ also offers a Learning for Life Programme (LLP) titled 'All for Sports, Sports for All @ ACSJ'. It features key sports such as tennis, rugby, table tennis and swimming to promote a pervasive sporting culture.

The school has kept on course by providing young girls of all races, religions and backgrounds with a unique brand of education distinctive of the Convent. The school's mission characterized by values of humility and service reflected in the motto of all CHIJ schools around the world - ""Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty"", is an identity worn with pride by every Convent girl. Capitalizing on the unique opportunities afforded in an all-girls' school, the convent education provided in CHIJ Kellock is a commitment to recognizing the dignity of young ladies. The school recognizes that every girl is an individual who can and should strive to do her personal best for herself and for others and is therefore, committed to staying relevant and responsive to the changing educational landscape and demands of the 21st century.  The three tenets of the school vision; LEARN, LEAD and MAKE A DIFFERENCE are realised in the school's strategic directions to develop every Kellock girl's unique giftedness to become a Thoughtful Learner (LEARN), a Servant Leader (LEAD) and a Person for Others (MAKE A DIFFERENCE).

As a Christ-centred Learning Community, the students in the school receive a values-based learning experience that pushes them not just to learn but to LEAD and MAKE A DIFFERENCE, anchored on a set of values that form the compass for their words, actions and deeds.  The explicit teaching of values during lessons is done through specially customised Values-Education Lessons that supplement the usual Character and Citizenship Education programme. These lessons teach the students explicitly about what it means to think, speak and act in accordance to the school values, Complementing this effort is the school's Values Alive Series - a series of morning assembly talks conducted by student leaders  to share real life examples of people who have lived out the school values in extraordinary ways.  To help the students translate the values learnt into positive habits and attitudes, the school's PE and Sports CCA curriculum guides the children into thinking about and using relevant habits (inspired by Steven Covey's 8 habits) in their lesson. This Learning for Life programme (LLP) called Net Infinity puts values into action. Similarly, the school's annual Values@Play event provides another platform for students to make connections to the values of Friendship, Excellence, Respect, Resilience and Integrity through specially-designed games.   Central to and of significance to the Kellock Experience is the school's desired outcomes for the girls of the school to be persons of others that will make a difference, no matter their age. This is realised through the Kellock Volunteerism Programme and the annual Children for Children programme which sees the students of our school stepping forward to volunteer their time, energy and effort to make a difference to the disadvantaged in society."

Logic and analysis, honesty and team-work in games, all provide a sound foundation for understanding religion and living by one's beliefs. - We teach what is true, just, good and beautiful, guided by our Catholic philosophy which finds harmony not contradiction, in spirit and matter, in faith and reason. - Like parents, teachers labour to form the minds and characters of students and become transformed in the process, as teacher and student help each other grow as persons.  Students must learn how to learn as they need to teach themselves after leaving school. - Success in school means more than good examination results.  It means learning how to live as well as how to make a living.  Our mission is fulfilled when our students: - Understand and accept themselves and others, develop their talents in service to society, to nation and to the world. - Think logically and critically and express themselves effectively.   - Know clearly what they believe and why they believe.   - Believe and trust in God, maintain physical fitness and mental health, avoiding excesses and abuses, possess social awareness and a sense of responsibility for the common good.",BEDOK,EAST,EAST 7,GOVERNMENT-AIDED SCH,BOYS' SCHOOL,SINGLE SESSION,PRIMARY,No,No,No,No,Chinese,Malay,Tamil,"Our school has two Learning for Life Programmes (LLP): 1.

These programmes collectively develop the mental, physical and emotional wellness to give our students a firm foundation from which they can optimise their performance in their academic pursuit, CCAs and other school activities. The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Forensic & Pharmaceutical Science seeks to engage and excite our students in the learning of Science and enable students to experience how Science is applied in real life.  Through forensic science, the ALP taps on students' interest in learning the Science behind crime scene processing, through an array of hands-on activities.  Students will also be taught to appreciate the ethics behind forensic science."

Founded in 1888 by a missionary, Miss Sophia Blackmore, the school provides a holistic education based on Christian values. We believe that God places students in our school for a special reason. Hence we are committed to helping all students develop their talents to the full, and nurture the four Fairsian Outcomes of wisdom, personhood, commitment to community and heart of service. The Fairfield curriculum is undergirded by the WHEEL philosophy to provide Fairsians with holistic, enriched and experiential learning. We strongly believe that education should go beyond the boundaries of the syllabuses and that students should be given a chance to explore beyond the classroom. We also believe that students should be engaged in meaningful and authentic experiences so that deep learning can occur when they reflect, connect the dots and seek to apply what they have learned in a real world context. The Fairfield curriculum also seeks to develop strong moral and performance character as we nurture leaders with a strong personal voice who can exert a gracious and positive influence on the community.",QUEENSTOWN,SOUTH,SOUTH 2,GOVERNMENT-AIDED SCH,CO-ED SCHOOL,SINGLE SESSION,SECONDARY,No,Yes,No,No,Chinese,Malay,Tamil,"Aligned with the WHEEL philosophy, and the development of 21st century competencies, one signature programme of the school is the Fairfield Learning Experience (FLEX) week. During this week, students are exposed to various aspects of holistic education outside the classroom: Social Awareness, Outdoor Education, Values-in Action and Educational and Career Guidance. The school also offers the 'Voice of a Fairsian' oracy programme which prepares students to speak with confidence both in English as well as their Mother Tongue. Besides learning to be effective communicators, students also develop a personal voice with which they articulate, persuade and convince others. The Life Science Programme, Inter-disciplinary River Study Project, and Community Problem-Solving Project are other learner-centric academic programmes which enable our students to develop academic thinking and skills. Our Character & Citizenship Education Programme, as well as weekly chapel and daily devotions, emphasises values and lifeskills and provides opportunities for students to be a blessing to the community. To bring about a student-led school, we offer a comprehensive leadership training programme for all students--they learn to lead themselves and influence their peers.  More specific and specialised training is also provided to advance the leadership competencies of student leaders."
